# CodeJudge: v.1.0.0 - Lambda
A simple, tool helping teachers to share exercises with their students, which are supposed to use the student version of CodeJudge which is an exam‑style code judge built with Flutter and a native C backend to help students practice and validate their programming logic.
**It is still in development!**

## Purpose & Benefits
CodeJudge is designed to help computer science students practice and prepare for their programming exams. It combines a modern Flutter UI with a high‑performance 
native C backend to simulate real exam conditions — without syntax highlighting, auto‑completion, or other IDE helpers. While it might help you to improve your 
skills, **there is no guarantee that it will improve your skills or grades**.
All your code is stored locally on your device—**your data remains private and is never shared** by this app.


*You don't need to install all compilers and all interpreters, because they are just called when you select the programming languge in the training mode. It's allways possible to use the other languages too, by installing their compilers.*
